# TTGO Sonos Remote

This project allows you to switch rooms with a button, and then turn the Sonos speakers for that room off and on with the second button. If you hold the second button for a moment instead of simply clicking it it will skip to the next track

You'll need to configure /data/api.txt to reflect the address of your Sonos speaker system.
You'll need to edit /data/speakers.csv with the list of your rooms
You'll need to configure /data/wifi.txt with your SSID and password
